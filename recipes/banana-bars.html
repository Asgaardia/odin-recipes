    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These soft and chewy banana bars, loaded with decadent chocolate and white chocolate chips, are delicious any time of the day.</p>
    <p>If you are somehow able to resist eating them all right away, they freeze well for up to three months.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7 1/2 very ripe bananas (about 3 1/3 cups)</li>
        <li>1 1/8 cups brown sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white chocolate chips, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 cup mini chocolate chips, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray two 9x13 metal pans with non-stick spray.</li>
        <li>Peel bananas and mash well. Stir in brown sugar, oil, milk, and eggs until well combined.</li>
        <li> Add in dry ingredients and stir. Fold in half of the chocolate and white chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter into the prepared pans and sprinkle the remaining chocolate and white chocolate chips on top.</li>
        <li>Bake 17-22 minutes, until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
